<h1>Neighborhood Map Irvive, CA</h1>

============================

The app uses the Foursquare API's <b>venues/explore</b> endpoint to get the list of ten restaurants in Irvine, CA. I am doing this by providing the category <em>food</em> to the <em>section</em> parameter in the API request to Foursquare.


The four square data is displayed in a list format and also as markers on the map using the Google Maps API.

Additional information about each location is given in an info box window which appears when either the list item, or the marker is clicked for a particular location.


The search bar provides functionality to filter results from the list. You may filter the list based upon the name of the restaurant.

When a restaurant name is clicked, the marker corresponding to the retaurant is centered in the map.
